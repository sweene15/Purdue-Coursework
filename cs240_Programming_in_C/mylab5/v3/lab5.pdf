Explanation for behavior in Problem 3

In this example, we replace system() with execl().
execl() stands for execute and leave, so when this command is run, the entire executable is stopped just afterward. 
When execl() is not called, e.g. when commands from the custom shell are run such as "dprompt", the program completes the action and resets, ready to recieve another command.
When an execl() command is run however, the program stops entirely after the completion of the command. In the case of /bin/date, the date is printed and the shell quits. Do to this behavior, the "Hello World?" string is never printed.
